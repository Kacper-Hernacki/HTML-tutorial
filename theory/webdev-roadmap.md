# Web Development Roadmap 

## Intro

Web development is not just a single programming language or tool. It is a complex process, which constantly evolves. Jumping into single programming language can be much easier, than beginning web development journey, that is why complex roadmap is the key to success. 

What is worth to mention, roadmaps should be udpated with time, because everyday are deployed new useful frameworks, libraries or even languages.

## Learning basics of Internet

This point is practically always skipped, what can cause real problems in further steps of development. It is highly recommended to know listed below subjects (answers are attached in file `/webdev-basics.md`):
- How the Internet works?
- What is browser, how it is built,
- How websites are displayed,
- DOM structure,
- https requests and responses,

Do not try to become super expert, just understand basic aspect and start learning fundamentals.

## Fundamentals

Core of web development is always the same:
- HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language),
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets),
- JS (Javascript).
